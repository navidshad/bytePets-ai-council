# AGENTS.md — AI Council Decision Workflows

This file is the **single source of truth** for how AI agents run the decision-making workflows in this repo. It is the cross-tool standard: **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **Antigravity**, and **Cursor** all read it. The thin per-tool files point back here:

- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code pointer + Claude Code spawning notes.
- `GEMINI.md` — Gemini CLI **and** Antigravity pointer + their spawning notes.
- `.gemini/agents/*.md` — the personas as native Gemini CLI subagents.

If a per-tool file and this file disagree on *workflow*, this file wins. The per-tool files only add *how to spawn agents in that tool* — never new rules.

## What this repo is

This repo is the **living product documentation** for **BytePets** — Vilnius's community-checked map for pet owners: find, add, confirm and share vets, pharmacies, pet-friendly places and walking areas, and match lost and found pets. The repo holds no product code. It is the source of truth for product strategy, technical architecture, marketing, metrics, and user-facing docs. The one exception is `studio/`, once it exists: the source of the marketing films, stills and slides. Agents build marketing pieces there (Workflow 4).

Every request flows through up to three stages — **triage** (is this trivial or a real decision?), then **depth** (how hard do we think?), then **output** (which record do we write?). The job of this file is to route the request through that flow and pick the cheapest path that does the job.

See `README.md` for the project pitch. See `docs/README.md` for the documentation map.

## Code repos are read-only for AI agents

AI agents may **read** the code repos for this product to audit, answer questions, ground a deliberation, or prepare tasks. They must **never edit code**: no file changes, no commits, no merges, no pushes in a code repo.

When an agent finds a code gap or bug, the output is:

1. a **task in your tracker** describing the change (preview with the owner first), and/or
2. a **doc update** in this repo if a living doc is stale.

Engineering changes are made by the team — not by agents. This applies to every tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor).

`studio/` in **this** repo is not a code repo in this sense. It is marketing source, and agents may edit it, render from it and commit to it, through a branch and a pull request (Workflow 4).

> The BytePets app and landing-page code live in separate repos. This repo holds only docs and decisions.

---

## Writing style — the house style

Write in plain everyday English. Both **chat replies** AND **product docs** (PR/FAQs, ADRs, council syntheses, living docs) should use it:

- Short sentences, one idea per sentence where possible.
- Common words. Avoid academic or business jargon (e.g. *ego-syntonic*, *load-bearing*, *decontextual*, *leverage* as a verb, *surface* as a verb, *thin sliver*, *addressable population*).
- Prefer short Anglo-Saxon words over long Latin ones: *use* not *utilise*, *help* not *facilitate*, *show* not *demonstrate*, *stop* not *discontinue*.
- Idioms and metaphors only if they are very common.
- Light bullets and numbered lists are fine when listing options.

Professional structure stays — formal headings, clear sections, neutral tone. "Professional" means clear and accurate, not dense or academic.

**Carry this into every subagent prompt.** When spawning a critic pass, a council lens, or a single-lens consult, include this writing-style instruction in the agent prompt. Without it, agents drift into academic English by default. (The native Gemini CLI subagents in `.gemini/agents/` already carry this in their system prompt.)

---

## How a request flows — think first, then choose the output

Every request goes through up to three stages. Cheap requests stop early; only real decisions reach the later stages. The key idea: **how hard you think (depth) and what record you write (output) are two separate choices.**

> **Precondition — is the repo initialized?** If template placeholders like `<PRODUCT_NAME>` still appear in the repo, it has not been set up yet. Run **Workflow 0 — Setup** (see `SETUP.md`) before any council / PR/FAQ / ADR work — the council needs real product facts to reason well.

### Stage 1 — Triage (always; cheap)

Read the request and sort it:

- **Trivial** — typo, formatting, file move, factual lookup, a clear single-answer question. Just do it or answer it. No agents, no doc. Stop here.
- **A real decision** — something a future reader will want the reasoning for. Go to Stage 2.

If you cannot tell which path fits, ask the user one short question. A wrong-tool deliberation is worse than a one-line clarifying question.

### Stage 2 — Depth (how hard do we think?)

Pick the lightest depth that does the job:

- **One lens** — one expert is clearly enough (e.g. a technical-only choice → the Technical Architect persona).
- **Council (many lenses)** — the decision is strategic or cross-functional (pricing, kill, pivot, sequence, go-to-market), or it would change a living doc (`docs/product/prd.md`, `docs/product/roadmap.md`, `docs/tech/architecture.md`, `docs/marketing/brand.md`). Default to the **2 most relevant** lenses and escalate only if a gap shows up. The council is for the few truly strategic calls per quarter, not the weekly question.

### Stage 3 — Output (which record do we write?)

Pick the record shape that fits the question. The shape is independent of the depth — a one-lens think can still produce a PR/FAQ, and a council can feed a PR/FAQ or an ADR.

| Question shape | Output | Lives in | Procedure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Should we **build** this feature? | **PR/FAQ** | `decisions/pr-faq/` | Workflow 2 |
| Which **technical option** do we pick? | **ADR** | `decisions/adr/` | Workflow 3 |
| What is the **strategic, cross-functional call**? | **Council synthesis** | `decisions/council/` | Workflow 1 |
| Make a **marketing video**, still, cover or slide deck | **Studio piece**: source in `studio/`, a row in `studio/videos.md` | `studio/` | Workflow 4 (`STUDIO.md`) |
| Trivial (typo, lookup, file move) | direct edit / answer | wherever it belongs | — |

Each procedure below (Workflows 1–3) is the common pairing of a depth with an output: the council procedure pairs many lenses with a synthesis; the PR/FAQ procedure pairs one critic lens with a feature doc; the ADR procedure pairs one architect lens with a technical doc.

**Rules**

1. Default to the cheapest path that does the job. Don't reach for the council when one lens is enough.
2. Outputs can chain. A PR/FAQ that surfaces real cross-functional tension escalates to a council. An ADR with product-strategy stakes escalates to a council. A council decision often spawns PR/FAQ or ADR follow-ups. The cheap-to-expensive direction is the common one.
3. Every output ends by appending a one-line entry to the **Decision Log** at the bottom of `docs/README.md`. The log is a thin table of contents — it points to the permanent file (PR/FAQ, ADR, or council synthesis) where the full rationale lives. See "Records and history" below.

---

## How to spawn personas (per tool)

The workflows below say "spawn a lens" or "spawn a critic." How you spawn depends on the tool. The persona content is the same everywhere; only the mechanism differs.

- **Claude Code** — spawn each persona with the **Task** tool (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`), reading `agents/<role>.md` verbatim into the prompt. Spawn in parallel: one message, several Task calls. See `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Gemini CLI** — the personas are **native subagents** in `.gemini/agents/*.md` (names: `product-manager`, `ux-designer`, `technical-architect`, `business-strategist`). The main agent calls each as a tool, or you force one with `@product-manager`. Each runs in its **own isolated context** — independence is guaranteed. They may run one after another, not truly at the same time; that is fine, isolation gives the same independent reasoning. **A Gemini subagent cannot call another subagent.** So the **main agent** always does the synthesis — never ask a subagent to synthesize or to read another subagent. See `GEMINI.md`.
- **Antigravity** — no native subagent files needed. Spawn each persona in the **Agent Manager** as a separate agent, pasting the persona file (`agents/<role>.md`) plus the grounding pack into the prompt. Run them as parallel agents. The main agent synthesizes. See `GEMINI.md`.

`agents/*.md` is the canonical, human-readable persona source (used verbatim by Claude Code and Antigravity). `.gemini/agents/*.md` is the same content compiled into Gemini CLI's native subagent format. **If you change a persona, update both `agents/<role>.md` and `.gemini/agents/<role>.md`.**

Track multi-step workflows with your tool's todo / task list (TodoWrite in Claude Code, the todo/plan view in Gemini CLI, the task list in Antigravity).

---

## Records and history

The repo's memory is layered. Each layer has a different job — keeping them separate avoids duplication and drift.

- **Permanent files** (`decisions/pr-faq/`, `decisions/adr/`, `decisions/council/`) — the full reasoning behind each decision lives here. PR/FAQs, ADRs, and council syntheses are committed and never rewritten after acceptance. To change a decision, write a new file that supersedes the old one.
- **Living docs** (`docs/product/prd.md`, `docs/product/roadmap.md`, `docs/tech/architecture.md`, `docs/marketing/*`, etc.) — the current state of the product. These get edited as decisions land.
- **Git history** — the source of truth for *what changed and why*. Use rich commit messages with prefixes (`Council:`, `PR/FAQ:`, `ADR-NNN:`) and put the headline rationale in the message body. `git log --grep="^Council:"` is the chronological view of council decisions.
- **Decision Log** in `docs/README.md` — a thin one-line-per-entry table of contents that points to the permanent file. The log makes decisions discoverable; it does NOT duplicate rationale. If the log and a permanent file disagree, the file wins.
- **Ephemeral scratch** (`.council-temp/session_<id>/`) — gitignored. Per-agent perspective files are deleted after the synthesis is written. Only the synthesis is promoted to a permanent file.

**What NOT to keep:** session transcripts, agent reasoning logs, intermediate drafts. They age badly and the synthesis already captured the verdict.

---

## Workflow 0 — Setup (run once)

Use this the first time you open a fresh clone of the template, or whenever the product changes a lot. The goal: replace every placeholder with real product facts so the lenses reason from truth, not from `<...>` tokens.

Setup is a **main-thread routine** — an interview plus a bulk edit, not a council deliberation. In short:

1. **Detect.** If `<PRODUCT_NAME>` still appears anywhere in the repo, it is not set up. Offer to run setup before any other workflow.
2. **Interview.** Use the initializer prompt in `SETUP.md`. Ask in small batches. If the user pastes a pitch / PRD / link, read it first and ask only for what is missing.
3. **Fill in.** Apply the fill-in map in `SETUP.md`: product name and pitch everywhere, the four persona Context blocks (and their Gemini mirrors), and the `docs/` skeleton. Add a 5th domain lens if the user wants one.
4. **Finalize.** Remove the template banners, confirm no `<...>` tokens remain, and commit with `Setup: initialize council for <PRODUCT_NAME>`.

The full question set, the fill-in map, and the finalize steps live in **`SETUP.md`**. Follow that file — this section is the pointer.

---

## Workflow 1 — Council (cross-functional strategic decisions)

Use when the question is **strategic, cross-functional, or would change a living document**. Typical triggers:

- "ask the council …", "what does the council think …", "council, deliberate on …"
- "should we kill / pivot / re-sequence …"
- "how should we price / position …"
- any proposed change to `docs/product/prd.md`, `docs/product/roadmap.md`, `docs/tech/architecture.md`, or `docs/marketing/brand.md`

Do **not** activate the council for: typo fixes, single-feature pitches (use PR/FAQ), tech-only choices (use ADR), or anything where one expert lens is clearly enough.

### The lenses

The personas live in `agents/` (canonical) and `.gemini/agents/` (Gemini-native mirror):

- `agents/product-manager.md` — strategic prioritization, roadmap, user impact
- `agents/ux-designer.md` — UX, interaction patterns, accessibility, design system
- `agents/technical-architect.md` — feasibility, scalability, performance, tech debt
- `agents/business-strategist.md` — monetization, go-to-market, unit economics, competitive position

Each file is the **complete persona prompt** for that agent — never paraphrase, always read and forward verbatim into the subagent (Claude Code / Antigravity). In Gemini CLI the persona is already the subagent's system prompt.

> **Adding a domain lens.** Many products need a fifth, domain-specific lens (e.g. a Security Expert, a Clinician, a Data Scientist, a Learning Scientist). To add one, copy an existing persona file as a starting point, rewrite the Role / Expertise / Persona / Decision Framework for the new domain, and add a Gemini mirror in `.gemini/agents/`. Spawn it **selectively** — only when the topic touches its domain — using the same two-tier discipline as the others.

### Steps

Track these steps with your tool's todo / task list.

**1. Build the grounding pack.** Before spawning any agent, the main thread reads the relevant context once and writes a short grounding block — key metrics from `docs/metrics/framework.md`, recent user feedback the user mentioned, known competitive moves, and any user-supplied context. This block is passed *inline* to every agent so they don't re-read the same source docs. Aim for ≤ 400 words total. Without this, the council reasons in a vacuum and pays the same context cost several times over.

**2. Pick the lenses (two-tier default).** Default to spawning the **2 most relevant** lenses for the topic, not all of them. For each lens, ask: does this lens have material input on this specific decision? If a lens has nothing distinctive to add (e.g. a pure pricing question rarely needs UX; a pure infra-cost question rarely needs the PM), skip it for tier 1 and note why. The skipped lenses are held in reserve and only spawned in step 5 if synthesis surfaces a real gap.

**3. Create a session directory.** Path: `.council-temp/session_<UTC-timestamp>/` (format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`). The `.council-temp/` directory is gitignored — sessions are ephemeral. Get the timestamp via shell: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S"`.

**4. Spawn the chosen lenses (independent + concurrent where possible).** Spawn one subagent per chosen lens. They must reason **independently** — never let them read each other's files. Where the tool supports it, run them at the same time (Claude Code: one message with several Task calls; Antigravity: parallel agents in the Agent Manager). In Gemini CLI they may run one after another as separate isolated subagent calls — that still gives independent reasoning. See "How to spawn personas (per tool)" above.

Each agent prompt must:

1. Tell the agent which persona it is. (Claude Code / Antigravity: tell it to read `agents/{role-file}.md` first. Gemini CLI: the persona is already the subagent's system prompt — just give it the task.)
2. Include the grounding pack from step 1 *inline* in the prompt.
3. State the deliberation topic clearly with all relevant context.
4. Point the agent at **1–2 specific files** to consult before writing — not whole folders. If the grounding pack already covers it, skip the file read.
5. Tell them to write their response to `.council-temp/session_<id>/<role>.md` using the format below, **and** to report back a one-paragraph summary + confidence number.
6. Tell them to stay in character, end with a confidence rating (1–10), and NOT to read the other agents' files.

#### Subagent prompt template

```
You are the {ROLE} on the BytePets AI Product Council.

Step 1 — Persona. (Claude Code / Antigravity: read your persona file agents/{role-file}.md and adopt that voice and decision framework. Gemini CLI: you already are this persona.)
Step 2 — Read for context (only these files, not whole folders): {1–2 specific paths}. If the grounding pack below already covers what you need, skip this step.
Step 3 — Use the grounding pack below as current state. Do not re-read what is summarised here.

GROUNDING PACK:
{paste the inline grounding block from step 1}

Step 4 — Deliberate on: {full topic + user-provided context}.
Step 5 — Write your perspective to: .council-temp/session_{id}/{role}.md

Use this exact structure:

# {Role} Perspective

**Request**: {topic}
**Time**: {UTC timestamp}

## Analysis
{your reasoning from your discipline's lens}

## Recommendation
{concrete recommendation — be opinionated}

## Pre-mortem
{imagine this decision fails 6 months from now — what is the most likely cause?}

## Questions/Concerns
{open questions, risks, things you'd want to validate}

## Confidence
{1–10 — how confident are you in your recommendation, and why? One sentence.}

Stay strictly in your discipline's lens. Do NOT read the other agents' session files — independent perspectives are the point. Report back with a one-paragraph summary of your recommendation and your confidence number.

**Writing style.** Write your perspective AND your reply to the main thread in plain everyday English — short sentences, common words, no academic jargon (this is the repo house style; see AGENTS.md → "Writing style"). Professional structure stays (headings, sections, neutral tone) but the language must be easy to read. Prefer short Anglo-Saxon words over long Latin ones.
```

**5. Synthesize. Escalate only if gaps appear.** The **main agent** reads the perspective files written in step 4 (in Gemini CLI, also use the summaries each subagent returned). Write `.council-temp/session_<id>/synthesis.md` using the verdict-doc structure from `.council-temp/README.md` (Decision, Sequence, Why, Open Issues, Action Items — omit any section with no substance). Target ≤300 words for the body (canonical tables / copy that downstream living docs will reuse are exempt from the word target — they are the source of truth, not deliberation residue).

The synthesis is a **verdict doc, not a transcript**. Write it as if the per-agent files don't exist — because for the future reader, they don't. Do not include a Perspectives Summary, an Areas of Agreement list, or any section that just restates what the Decision already says. Disagreements that actually shaped the verdict go into a one-sentence note inside `## Why` or into `## Open Issues`; "no hard disagreements" is not a section, it is a sign to omit the section.

If during synthesis you identify a gap that one of the *unspawned* lenses would fill (e.g. "we have no read on technical feasibility"), spawn that lens now using the same template and the same grounding pack, then re-synthesize. Record skipped lenses in the commit body, not in the permanent file.

**If two or more agents rated their confidence below 6, flag that as a "go get more data" signal rather than ship.**

**6. Persist the synthesis and update the living docs.** Two parts:

a. **Promote the synthesis to a permanent file.** Move `.council-temp/session_<id>/synthesis.md` to `decisions/council/<NNN>-<slug>.md` (next sequential number, kebab-case slug). The `**Lenses**` field at the top is a single comma-separated line — no justification for skipped lenses inside the permanent file (that belongs in the commit body). The per-agent perspective files stay in `.council-temp/` and are deleted with the session — only the synthesis survives.

b. **Edit the living docs.** For each Action Item in the synthesis, edit the relevant `docs/**/*.md` file directly.

Then append a one-line entry to the **Decision Log** at the bottom of `docs/README.md`:

```
- {YYYY-MM-DD} — Council — {short topic title} — `decisions/council/<NNN>-<slug>.md`
```

Commit with the prefix `Council:` and put the headline decision in the commit message body. The synthesis file + the docs diff + the commit body together are the permanent record. The log entry is just a discoverability pointer; do not duplicate the rationale there.

**7. Report back to the user.** Summarize: what was decided, which lenses ran (and which were skipped, with reasoning), where the agents disagreed and how it resolved, what files changed, and what remains open. Keep it concise — the diffs and decision log entry are the artifacts.

---

## Workflow 2 — PR/FAQ (should we build this feature?)

Use when the question is **"should we build feature X?"** or **"is this idea good enough to put on the roadmap?"**. The PR/FAQ forces you to state user-facing value before any work starts. If you can't write a compelling press release, you don't have a feature — you have an idea.

### Steps

**1. Draft the PR/FAQ.** Copy `templates/pr-faq-template.md` to `decisions/pr-faq/<NNN>-<slug>.md` (next sequential number, kebab-case slug). Fill in every section. Be specific about the user, the problem, the moment of use, and the headline customer benefit. **Release scope is named `Phase 1` / `Phase 2` / `Phase 3` — not `V1` / `V2` / `V3`.** The Phase wording is clearer and avoids confusion with product-version numbers.

**2. Critic pass.** After drafting, spawn ONE subagent whose job is to find the strongest objections. Prompt: "Read `decisions/pr-faq/<file>.md`. You are a skeptical investor reviewing this for fundability. List the three strongest reasons this should NOT be built, the weakest claim in the PR section, and any FAQ answer that is hand-wavy. Be specific and harsh. **Write in plain everyday English — short sentences, common words, no academic jargon** (the repo house style)." Append the critique to the bottom of the PR/FAQ under `## Critic Pass`.

**3. Decide.** Read the critique. Either revise and proceed, set the doc's `Status` to `Rejected` with reasoning, or — if the critique surfaces real cross-functional trade-offs (pricing, positioning, infra cost, go-to-market) — escalate to the council. Set `Status` to `Pending Council` and run Workflow 1 with the PR/FAQ as input context.

**4. Log it.** Append a one-line entry to the **Decision Log** at the bottom of `docs/README.md`:

```
- {YYYY-MM-DD} — PR/FAQ ({Approved/Rejected/Escalated}) — {feature name} — `decisions/pr-faq/<NNN>-<slug>.md`
```

The PR/FAQ file itself is the permanent record — committed to git and part of the product memory, not ephemeral. Commit with the prefix `PR/FAQ:` and put the headline decision in the message body.

---

## Workflow 3 — ADR (architectural decision records)

Use when the question is **a technical/architectural choice with multiple valid options** and you want a permanent record of *why* you picked one. Examples: choosing a database, picking a caching strategy, deciding on a state-management approach, choosing a payment integration.

Do **not** use ADRs for routine implementation choices — ADRs are for decisions a future engineer would want to understand the reasoning behind.

### Steps

**1. Draft the ADR.** Copy `templates/adr-template.md` to `decisions/adr/<NNN>-<slug>.md` (next sequential number). Fill in: Status, Context (what forces are at play), Decision (what we're doing), Alternatives Considered (with reasons rejected), Consequences (good and bad).

**2. Single-lens review.** The Technical Architect persona is the natural reviewer. Spawn ONE subagent: "Adopt the Technical Architect persona (read `agents/technical-architect.md`, or use the `technical-architect` subagent in Gemini CLI). Then read `decisions/adr/<file>.md`. Critique the decision and the alternatives. Are the trade-offs honest? Is anything missing? Append your critique to the doc under `## Architect Review`. **Write in plain everyday English — short sentences, common words, no academic jargon** (the repo house style)."

**3. Decide.** Revise based on the review. Set Status to `Accepted`, `Rejected`, or `Superseded by ADR-NNN`.

**4. Log it.** Append a one-line entry to the **Decision Log** at the bottom of `docs/README.md`:

```
- {YYYY-MM-DD} — ADR-{NNN} ({Accepted/Rejected}) — {decision title} — `decisions/adr/<NNN>-<slug>.md`
```

ADRs are committed to git. They're never edited after acceptance — to change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one. Commit with the prefix `ADR-{NNN}:` and put the rationale in the message body.

---

## Workflow 4 — Studio (marketing films, stills and slides)

Use this when someone asks for a marketing piece: a launch or product film, a short clip for social, a video cover, store or launch-gallery images, a slide deck. The full routine lives in **`STUDIO.md`** — this section is the pointer.

**Depth.**
- Most pieces need no lens: `docs/marketing/brand.md`, the studio foundation and the chosen kit already hold the rules.
- Ask the **Business Strategist** lens when the piece makes a new public claim, aims at a new audience, or touches price.
- Ask the **UX Designer** lens when a new design kit is proposed.
- A change to the brand itself (the mark, the palette, the voice, the claims in `brand.md`) is a council call.

**In short.**

1. **Three layers: foundation → design kits → design cases.** The foundation is what every piece shares (mark, brand tokens, honesty rules, formats, render tools). A **design kit** is one complete look with its reusable parts; a studio can hold several. A **design case** is one piece (a film, a still set, a cover, a deck) made with one kit.
2. **Set up on first use.** The template ships no studio. The first time a piece is asked for, create `studio/` from `STUDIO.md` §2, then the foundation and a kit, and only then the case.
3. **Kit before case.** The founder approves a new kit's kit sheet before any case uses it. A case uses its kit's parts and never copies them; a missing part is added to the kit.
4. **Case steps: brief → story → key frames → silent cut → sound → master**, with the founder approving the brief, the story, the key frames and the review cut (`STUDIO.md` §6.3).
5. **Publish private.** Only the founder makes an upload public. Every upload gets a row in `studio/videos.md`.
6. **Commit the source** on a branch with a pull request, prefix `Studio:`. Never commit a video.

Studio pieces need no Decision Log entry unless they carry out a decision. Their log is `studio/videos.md`.

---

## Editing rules for living docs

- **Roadmap, PRD, architecture, brand** — never edit these without a council deliberation. They are the strategic spine.
- **Metrics framework, feature specs, marketing tactics** — single-lens edits are fine if the user is clear, but flag if a strategic shift is implied.
- **User-facing docs (`docs/user-docs/`), getting-started, terms** — treat as legal/customer-facing; edit only with explicit user instruction.
- **The studio foundation and design kits (`studio/foundation/`, `studio/kits/`)** — refining a kit or adding one is a single-lens edit with the founder's OK; re-check the key frames of the cases that use a kit before changing it. A change to the foundation that alters the brand (the mark, the palette, the voice, the honesty rules) follows `brand.md` and goes through the council.

Always preserve the existing voice and structure of the doc you're editing. The living docs are versioned in git — make commits self-contained and message them like decisions, not edits (e.g., `Council: prioritize onboarding redesign ahead of referrals`, `PR/FAQ: approve saved-search alerts`, `ADR-007: adopt Postgres over DynamoDB`).

---

## Turning decisions into work

When a PR/FAQ, ADR, or council decision turns into engineering work, the work goes into your task tracker. A few light rules keep tasks clean:

- **Lead each task title with a verb and the outcome.** A developer who has never seen this project should be able to read the title and know what to do. No internal acronyms in the title.
- **One task = one ownable piece of work.** A PR/FAQ becomes several tasks, not one. Don't bundle work that spans two code repos into one task — split it into two linked tasks.
- **Always preview the task list with the owner before creating any task.** Nothing lands in the tracker without explicit approval of the name, the description, and the scope.
- **Link each task back to its decision doc** (PR/FAQ, ADR, or council file) so the reasoning is one click away.

> This is deliberately light. If your team wants a strict task convention (fixed scope field, a description template, UX hand-off rules), add it here.

---

## Anti-patterns

- **Defaulting to the council.** It's the most expensive workflow. Use PR/FAQ or ADR when they fit.
- **Spawning every lens by default.** Two-tier is the default — pick the 2 most relevant lenses, escalate to more only when synthesis reveals a real gap.
- **Running chosen lenses sequentially when the tool can run them together.** In Claude Code and Antigravity, spawn the tier in parallel. (In Gemini CLI, isolated subagent calls may run one after another — that is acceptable because isolation already gives independent reasoning.)
- **Skipping the grounding pack.** Without it each agent re-reads the same source docs and you pay the same context cost N times over.
- **Paraphrasing personas.** Read the full persona file each session (or rely on the native subagent system prompt in Gemini CLI).
- **Letting council agents read each other.** Synthesis is the main agent's job, not theirs. (In Gemini CLI this is enforced — subagents cannot call or read other subagents — so never structure the council so a subagent must synthesize.)
- **Skipping the Decision Log entry.** Decisions become hard to find without it. (The permanent record is the doc + commit; the log is the discovery layer.)
- **Duplicating rationale into the log.** The log is a thin table of contents — one line per entry. The full reasoning lives in the permanent file and the commit body.
- **Persisting agent perspectives.** Only the synthesis is promoted to `decisions/council/`. Per-agent perspective files stay ephemeral in `.council-temp/` and are deleted with the session.
- **PR/FAQ without a critic pass.** A beautifully written PR/FAQ for a bad idea is still a bad idea.
- **ADRs that hide alternatives.** The "Alternatives Considered" section is the entire point — without it an ADR is just a memo.
- **Convening any workflow for trivial requests.** Direct edit is fine for typos, formatting, factual lookups, and obvious clarifications.
- **In-chat revision markers on decision docs.** When iterating on a PR/FAQ, ADR, or council synthesis within a single chat, do NOT annotate with "Rev 2", "(after critic pass)", "what was addressed", or any other changelog-style markers inside the doc. Edit the body in place until it reads as a single stable version. Revisions live in git — the commit message body carries "what changed", that is git's job, not the doc's. The Status field stays a single value, no parenthetical version note.
- **Synthesis as transcript.** The council synthesis is a verdict doc, not a record of the deliberation. Do NOT include a Perspectives Summary, an Areas of Agreement list, a Points of Contention section when there is no contention, or any section that just restates the Decision in different words. The per-agent files are deleted with the session — the permanent file must stand alone for a reader who has never seen them.
- **Process-citations inside decision docs.** Inline parentheticals like `(deduplicated)` or `(no revision markers)` are notes-to-self, not part of the decision. The rules they cite already live in this file; re-citing them inside the synthesis is noise for the future reader.
- **A case that copies its kit.** Cases use the kit's parts in place. A part a case needs goes into the kit, so the next case gets it too.
- **Committing a video or render output.** The studio keeps source only; a video is a re-render or a link in `studio/videos.md`.
- **Building a published asset in a scratch folder.** A cover, thumbnail or store image whose source sits in a temp folder is lost when the folder is cleared. Its source goes in `studio/`.
- **Publishing a marketing piece without the founder.** Uploads stay private until the founder makes them public.
- **A film or slide that claims more than the product does.** Check `brand.md` and the honesty rules in `STUDIO.md` §4 before anything is rendered.
- **Justifying skipped lenses inside the permanent file.** The `**Lenses**` field is a single line listing which lenses ran. Why a lens was skipped is a commit-body concern, not a section of the synthesis.
